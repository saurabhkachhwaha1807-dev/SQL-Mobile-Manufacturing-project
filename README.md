# 📱 Advanced SQL Case Study: Mobile Manufacturer Data Analysis
 
  This project involved analyzing Mobile Manufacturer sales data structured in a star schema. The analysis focused on complex, multi-table queries to drive business insights, including: identifying the top-buying US   state for a specific brand (e.g., Samsung) , showing transaction volumes by model, zip code, and state , calculating the average price for models within the top five selling manufacturers , and assessing customer    spending habits. A key component was time-based analysis to compare sales between 2009 and 2010, identifying manufacturers and models with inconsistent annual sales presence.
